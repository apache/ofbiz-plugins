== Components
A Vue.Js component is defined by 3 distinct blocks ( template, script, style ) which are regrouped in a single '.vue' file.

. Template :
* Template must be contained in a single root element (div, span, table, ect... ) +
* In template we can access computed properties and function with double curly bracket *{{}}* +
* Classic html attributes can be preceded by ':' to use script properties and js code instead of plain text
* Vue.Js give us some directives (v-for, v-if v-on:click, ect...) that are bind to script context and work like a classic
attribute preceded by ':' and so can bind to script part and interpret js.

. Script
* Script section is wrapped into an `export default {}` that contain the whole script elements.
TIP: import have to be made before this export
* This export is a map that can contain predefined keys used by Vue.Js (data, computed, methods, props, created, ect...)
** data() is a function that contain variable used is the component context. +
All variable contained in data() are reactive, which mean that Vue.Js will track any change on them and will reverberate
theses changes everywhere there are used to reevaluate render.
** computed is a map that contain evaluation based on reactive data. +
They can be used like a reactive variable in the component and will reevaluate itself when one of its entry had changed.
** methods is a map containing helper function (handleClick, doPost, ect...). +
WARNING: these functions don't aim to be reactive.
** props is an array of string who give attribute to the component for passing data from its parent to it.
** This section can also contain *hooks* of the component life cycle (created(), mount(), beforeUpdate(), ect...). +
Theses block of code will be executed when the hook is fired. +

. Style +
This part is dedicated to internal css of the component. +
Style of this part is applied before other style of the project.

== Vuex
Vuex is the centralised state system of the application.
It allow us to create 'store' which contain data that can be accessed/modified by any component of the application.

A store is composed of 4 elements :

. `State` +
State is a map that contain all stored informations. +
State can only be modify by `mutation`.
Default state's data will be reactive. +
If Data had to be added in the state after its creation, they must be added with the method `Vue.set()` for them to be reactive.

. `Mutations` +
Mutations is a map that contain function allowed to alter state.
By convention, mutation's key have to be upper-case.
Mutations can't be accessed through code, they must be called by actions.
Mutations must be synchronous.

. `Actions` +
Mutation first aim to fire mutation. +
Actions can be asynchronous, in which case there return a promise.

. `Getters` +
Getters allow to access state data. +
Getters are reactive. +
Getters can use parameters, if they are they return a function instead of a reactive variable. +

Store can be split into modules who can be described in an index.js file, stores can so be stored into a modules repository. +
