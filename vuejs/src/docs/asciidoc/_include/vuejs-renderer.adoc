= Vue.Js Renderer

Actually the first javascript application enabling to use portlet system - portal Apache OFBiz is written with the Vue.js framework.

Vue.js has been choose for its easy learning curve and its community driven development instead of a corporation. +
In Vue.js, library vuetify has been choosen, because it's base on material design and have e very active community, so seem
to be the most used vue.js GUI libraries.

== POC Vuejs Renderer installation

. From a standard trunk ofbiz-framework with 205914a1beb commit or superior (that can be downloaded at
https://ofbiz.apache.org/source-repositories.html[documentation standard  SourceRepository] using git).
. Create the 'plugins' repository at ofbiz-framework root folder.
. In the Apache OFBiz plugins repository, download the next repository using git :
.. *example plugin* at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ofbiz/ofbiz-plugins/trunk/example
. In the ofbizextra plugins repository, download the 3 next repositories using git :
.. *vuejsportal plugin* that can be downloaded at https://gitlab.ofbizextra.org/ofbizextra/ofbizplugins/vuejsPortal
   all vuejs components, a new ScreenViewHandler and 4 new renderers (screen, form, menu, tree) and all common files to all
   fjs component.
.. *examplefjs plugin* that can be downloaded at https://gitlab.ofbizextra.org/ofbizextra/ofbizplugins/examplefjs.git
   specifics files for using vue.js with ofbiz example component
.. *flatgreyfjs plugin* that can be downloaded at https://gitlab.ofbizextra.org/ofbizextra/ofbizplugins/flatgreyfjs.git
   dedicated theme for vue.js with vuetify library
. In the ofbizextra git repository download ofbizJiraPatchAvailable project +
  If there are some files, some patch may be necessary for this POC, for each patch you can goto JIRA
  to have more explanation for each. +
  To apply them it is recommended to create a branch on your ofbiz, and apply the patchs with git command
  `git am patchName`. Currently these patchs are necessary:
  .. OFBIZ-11645_0001-simple-methods-optional-in-compound-file.patch <= compound-widget files are used in POC
  .. OFBIZ-11676_0001-Fixed-drop-down-field-not-work-when-in-a-compound-wi.patch  <= compound-widget files are used in POC
  .. OFBIZ-11708_0001-fixed-sort-order-field-not-works-in-CompoundWidgets.patch  <= compound-widget files are used in POC
. If there are some files in the ofbizCommit2add, it's some patch waiting jira creation or dedicated for this POC,
  so it's needed to apply them too
  with `git am fileName` at the ofbiz root directory (replace fileName by the patch file name and path)
. After that you have to modify some files of ofbiz-framework (ex: model.java because some tag are added). +
  For that, a (bash) script exist, it's located in the 'plugins/vuejs' : +
  `./tools/applyOfbizFilesPatchs.sh` +
  And then copy some files +
  `rsync -a --exclude-from=./ofbizFiles/rsyncExcludes ./ofbizFiles/ ../../` +
. To be able to build the vue.js application you must have Node.js installed on your system.
.. To install Node.js on a debian based system, execute the following commands : +
  `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -` +
  `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs` +
  In case of another system, you can consult https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions
.. Meanwhile an integrated gradle command
... Being located at 'plugins/vuejs/webapp/vuejs'
* `npm i` <= to install the project dependencies
* `npm run build-prod` <= to build the project (it's possible to use build-dev to be able to use browser dev-tools)
. You can now launch OFBiz as regular : +
`./gradlew cleanAll loadAll ofbiz` +
(being located at the *root of ofbiz-framework* )
. You can now connect to the application portal at https://localhost:8443/examplefjs/control/main

== POC choices

Apache OFBiz *trunk branch* usage.

Principe and architecture of Apache OFBiz *Portal Page and Porlet* usage.

The whole use cases are applied *to example component* and during the POC some new files used which should to be located in common
have been moved to examplefjs aiming to simplify the installation and update process.

With examplefjs, there is an *additional webapp (examplefjs)*, it centralize allowed URIs for vuejs component,
currently this applicationName is listed in constantes.js file. +
vuejs component is not bound to a component, it just need a base URI for send its requests.
This uri is temporary set in constantes.js but it will be more flexible later aiming to use vuejs with multiple components

Portal component ( https://localhost:8443/examplefjs/control/login ) use *ofbiz standard login by cookies* mechanism, it will
later use ofbiz login by token (cf. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-9833).

*screens, forms, menus* used for portlets are defined *with xml*, and dedicated files for better readability.

There is *a component (vuejs) for each ofbiz screen element* ( SingleItemRow => vue.single-item-row ), which are defined by
renderer for screen, form and menu ( and for html renderer that correspond globally to macro.ftl ). Actually, for the POC,
to list them, you can search in vuejs existing file for `Vue*.vue` in webapp/vuejs/src/component/ .

=== XML tags used
During the POC, few new properties or XML tags had been added but some of existing tags and properties had been distorted
for an exclusive Vue.Js use.

* screen
  ** in `<container` tag +
     container is the main piece of dynamics screen (update a part of screen on event)
    *** `id` is used to identify the container and enable to inject content into it with `set-area` later. +
         When set-area is done for this id, its content will be replace by the content received from area-target. +
         So, do not resend the container !
    *** `watcher-name` (new attribute) is a name in the local store (in web browser) which can contain some data (parameters).
         It's possible to update watcher content with a `set-watcher`. Each time the watcher content changes,
         the `auto-update-target` is called using watcher content as parameters to update the container. +
         If `refresh-area` is call, the refresh is done by using auto-update-target and watcher content (if exist).
    *** `auto-update-target` is used to bind a `watcher` to the container. +
        To use it with set-watcher, a new attribute `watcher-name` has been added, and when the content of this this watcher
        changes a set-area is done with auto-update-target as target and watcher content as parameters. +
        `auto-update-target` support the REST uri format with some parameters in it include with {}, value is populate with
        content of watcher content. If uri contain, at least one {xxx} or have no parameters a GET method will be used
        otherwise a POST will be used.
  ** screenlet
    *** collapsible, if collapsible = "true" then it's necessary to have a "unique" id to know what collapse when button is clicked.
        It's possible to have multiple screenlet with  same id or each with a different one. +
        So, it's important to give a `id` if collapsible ="true" otherwise collapse will collapse all screenlet without id !
    *** id : is manatory if the screenlet should be collapse
  ** in `platform-specific`-`html` tag a new tag
    *** `vuejs` is to call a specifics vuejs component named `component-name`. +
         it's possible to give to it some parameters with sub tag `parameters`
* form
  ** property `entity-name` is mandatory for grid or single form, vuejs use it to build entity store.
     When entity-name, exist data print to screen are associated to the web-browser local store, so when a data
     change in one screenlet, same data in an other screenlet will change too.
  ** in `<on-event-update-area` tag (there can be many of them and they will be executed in xml apparition order. It will wait
      current task is completed before starting the next one. If any of these events is set, the submit button will prevent
      the form default behaviour, so if you need to post in addition to vuejs feature you must add an event-type `submit`)
    *** `event-type` +
      Define the action to be executed during the form submitting (click on submit button). It can take one of next values :
      **** `submit` will submit the form to `area-target` with provided `parameter` elements. Like `set-area` if no `parameter`
            are defined it will use the whole form. Error and success messages will be displayed. +
            Form `target` support the REST uri format with some parameters in it include with {}, value is populate with
            content of form - fields when submit. +
            The http method used is POST, but you can add a field _method to choose the method received by the ofbiz controler
            (ex: PUT for an update)
      **** `set-area` update area with id `areaId` with the post result at URI `area-target` with included `parameter` elements. +
            If uri contain, at least one {xxx} or have no parameters a GET method will be used otherwise a POST will be used.
      **** `refresh-area` similar with set-area but target used will be the `auto-update-target` define at the container level
            and, if a watcher-name is define for this container, it's content will be used as parameters (for solving {} in target
            or as parameters if no {} in target.
      **** `set-watcher` update watcher `areaId` with included `parameter`. In case no parameter was passed to `set-watcher`
            it will use all form fields to update watcher content.
      **** `refresh-watcher` all container which watch a watcher-name are update when watcher content change, with refresh-watcher
            update is done without change watcher content.
      **** `collapse` do an action on collapse/expand screenlet. +
           `area-target` is the action to do : *collapse* or *expand* or *toggle*; +
           `area-id` is the `screenlet name` to change.
      **** `close-modal` close the current modal, currently `area-id` is necessary, when modal is open for a lookup areaId is
            {formName}_{fieldName};  area-target is not used, so can be left empty.
  ** in `<on-field-event-update-area` tag (there can be many of them and they will be executed in xml apparition order. It will wait
      current task is completed before starting the next one.)
    *** `event-type` +
      Define the action to be executed during the click on the associated hyperlink (<a link or button). It can take one of next values :
      **** `post` will post at URI `area-target` with the `parameter` elements included in the tag. If there are no parameters,
        it will use the whole form. It will display error and success messages.
      **** `put` will post at URI `area-target` with the http methof PUT if target contain {xxxx} xxxx will be replace by value
           if xxxx is define in parameters included in the tag. If there are no parameters, it will use the whole form.
           It will display error and success messages.
      **** `delete` will post at URI `area-target` with the http methof DELETE if target contain {xxxx} xxxx will be replace by value
           if xxxx is define in parameters included in the tag. If there are no parameters, it will use the whole form.
           It will display error and success messages.
      **** `set-area` update area with id `areaId` with the post result at URI `area-target` with included `parameter` elements. +
            If uri contain, at least one {xxx} or have no parameters a GET method will be used otherwise a POST will be used.
      **** `refresh-area` similar with set-area but target used will be the `auto-update-target` define at the container level
            and, if a watcher-name is define for this container, it's content will be used as parameters (for solving {} in target
            or as parameters if no {} in target.
      **** `set-watcher` update watcher `areaId` with included `parameter`. In case no parameter was passed to `set-watcher`
            it will use all form fields to update watcher content.
      **** `refresh-watcher` all container which watch a watcher-name are update when watcher content change, with refresh-watcher
            update is done without change watcher content.
      **** `set-field-in-form` will set the value of property `area-target` from form `area-id` from the actual field value.
      **** `collapse` do an action on collapse/expand screenlet. +
           `area-target` is the action to do : *collapse* or *expand* or *toggle*; +
           `area-id` is the `screenlet name` to change.
      **** `close-modal` close the current modal, `area-id` is to know which modal close, when modal is open for a lookup areaId is
            {formName}_{fieldName}; +
            if area-id is empty all modal are closed; +
            area-target is not used, so can be left empty.
  ** in `parameters` tag
    *** `auto-parameters-portlet` allow to automatically fill necessary portlet parameters :
      **** `portalPageId`
      **** `portalPortletId`
      **** `portletSeqId`
      **** `currentAreaId`
  ** in `<hyperlink` tag
    *** `link-type="anchor"` is used to make an internal call to FrontJs via `set-area`, `target-window` is used as
         id to update and `target` as area-target, parameters as parameters.
    *** `target-window` is used to design the watcherName that have to be updated.
    *** `url-mode` three new modes is added to be able to give the http method to use, POST is the default
      **** intra-post : do a http POST request for the set-area, and so sending multiple parameters
      **** intra-put : do the http request with a PUT method
      **** intra-delete : do the http request with a DELETE method
* menu
  ** in `<link` tag
    *** `link-type="set-area"` is used to make an internal call to FrontJs via `set-area`, `target-window` is used as
         id to update and `target` as area-target, it's a http get so parameters should be in target and
         if there area some {xxx} in target they will be replace by correct value with fields list in parameters.
    *** `link-type="auto"` (default value) and `url-mode="intra-app"` call the target-url to print a new
         page (using internal routing).
    *** `link-type="layered-modal"` is used to open a modal windows and do a set-area in it
    *** `url-mode` three new modes is added to be able to give the http method to use, POST is the default (except for set-area)
      **** intra-post : do a http POST request for the set-area, and so sending multiple parameters
      **** intra-put : do the http request with a PUT method
      **** intra-delete : do the http request with a DELETE method

=== decorator, lookup
Currently vuejs app is call in a ftl included in the classic mainDecorator, without application menu (which are directly
manage by vuejsApp cf <<_specifics_uri>>).

Currently a specifics theme has created, to be able to remove most of css to avoid "conflict" with vuetify lib. This theme
is forced in the main decorator of the application.

*Lookup*

1. `LookupDecorator` is a specifics one for VueJs, but its usage is same as the standard one. It contain 2 main specificity
  * for autocomplete return, all data are in viewData
  * for search - result, when lookup receive parameters.lookupResult = "Y" only result form is sent to be injected in area lookup-results
2. `LookupForm - find` :
  * it's necessary to add a hidden field
[source,XML]
   <field name="lookupResult"><hidden value="Y"/></field>

  * it's necessary to add 2 on-event-update-are, +
    first one to send result in the area lookup-result
    second one to collapse Find screenlet (if you want collapse it
[source,XML]
       <on-event-update-area event-type="set-area" area-id="lookup-results" area-target="LookupExample"/>
       <on-event-update-area event-type="collapse" area-id="LookupFindScreenlet" area-target="collapse"/>
3. `LookupForm - list` :
  * for the link return field, 2 on-field-event-update-area must be added +
     first one to set Field which call the lookup with the correct value +
     second one to close the modal
[source,XML]
            <on-field-event-update-area event-type="set-field-in-form" area-id="SelectExample" area-target="exampleId" />
            <on-field-event-update-area event-type="close-modal" area-id="SelectExample_exampleId" area-target="" />
4. `FindScreenDecorator`, is a specifics one for VueJs, but its usage is same as the standard one. Its specificity is about
    ListResult update. Some modifications should be done in the find form
  * add a hidden field onlyList
[source,XML]
            <field name="onlyList"><hidden value="Y"/><!-- used by FindScreenDecorator to only send list result --></field>
  * add a on-event-update-area to update List result area
[source,XML]
         <on-event-update-area area-target="findExample" event-type="set-area" area-id="search-results"/><!-- When parameters-map is empty all form field are sent  -->
  * add a on-event-update-area to collapse find screenlet (optional)
[source,XML]
       <on-event-update-area event-type="collapse" area-id="findScreenlet" area-target="collapse"/>


=== FrontJs Renderer
A *new viewHandler* and a new set of *renderer* had been created. +
A new package had been created in org.apache.ofbiz.widget.renderer named frontJs which contain all new renderer.

In this package, there is a new FrontJsOutput class which allow to construct necessary elements whit the wished format.
An object of this class is instantiate at the begin of viewHandler process, then is completed by rendered object call.

Uri *showPortletFj* of component examplefjs use the new viewHandler to return screen render result, showPortlet.

This URI is used by Vue.Js application for display information gathering. +
New viewHandle return a json which contain 2 maps ( viewScreen and viewEntities ). +
viewScreen contain all information about display.
viewEntities contain all information about data set.

In future revision, it will probably be feasible to only receive the data map.

=== Specifics URI
there is a *showPortal* URI in vuejs (CommonScreen), which is the Start point of the VueJs application.

*showPortlet* screen is redefine in this POC for simplification purpose, to only do what we want.

*applicationMenu* is a new uri which return with the FrontJsScreenViewHandler the data (ViewScreen & ViewData) from application xml menu. +
In each fjs component, it's necessary to define a view-map entry applicationMenu pointing to a screen.xml with only the correct menu.

=== REST URI
For OFBiz applications URI structure is : {resourceName}/{cover}/{Pkvalue: .*}

So, for Example resource, it translate into :
|===
| URI                         | method        |  Goal
| Example/find                | get           | find form to select options for list
| Example/list                | get (via post)| Example list, +
                                                => with a get (so without parameters) all the examples +
                                                => with a post (parameters and _method="GET") examples selected by options
| Example/create              | get           | create form
| Example/edit/{exampleId}    | get           | edit form and data for the id sent
| Example/show/{exampleId}    | get           | show form and data for the id sent
| Example/summary/{exampleId} | get           | summary form and data for the id sent
| Example/data/{exampleId}    | get           | just data for the id sent
| Example/change              | post          | create a example
| Example/change/{exampleId}  | put (via post)| update example with exampleId
| Example/change/{exampleId}  | delete        | delete example with exampleId
|===

All these actions([cover]) is about screenlet (part of a page), if cover should be for a page, its name is suffix by Pg.

[TIP]
HTTP request other than POST method cannot have parameters (other than in URI) so to be able to do a GET or a PUT with parameters
a workarround is to used a POST with added `<field name="_method"><hidden value="GET">` (or "PUT") in the form (or as one of the parameters).

[CAUTION]
TOMCAT httpServlet.java not manage PATCH method, so it's not usable

=== Added field
A new field had been added to PortalPagePortlet entity : *watcherName* which is the name of the watcher that fire portlet update.

=== ftl
ftl file can be mixed with Vue.js app, so it's necessary to create a dedicated component by ftl migrated. Look at
<<_xml_tags_used, XML tags used>> on point `platform-specific`-`html` - `vuejs`.
